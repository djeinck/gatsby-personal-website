## YouTube

- CS dojo has some decent stuff:

- TechLead on youtube, look for when he solves problems
- byte by byte on youtube
- interviewing.io on youtube
- the entire MIT algorithms course on youtube

Those are good ones I remember. I'll add more as I think of them but its not that hard to search either.

## Useful sites
Just do the free stuff on these 
- https://www.interviewcake.com/
- https://www.algoexpert.io/questions

- leetcode for practicing (stick to the easy and medium questions for the most part)
    - I saw this on github that could be helpful https://github.com/MisterBooo/LeetCodeAnimation/blob/master/README-En.md

## Books

1.  **Cracking the Code Interview** - good advise and sample problems with solutions
2.  Algorithm Design Manuel - skip the war stories
3.  Programing interviews exposed
